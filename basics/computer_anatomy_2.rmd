## More Anatomy 

Other common elements of, or accessories to, general-purpose computers include

* Input Devices (keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, scanner, microphone)

* Output Devices (screen/display, speakers, printer)

* Some devices may combine both input and output on a single physical connection

## Video Displays and Connectors

### Mutiple displays possible within certain limits.  Each display requires a distinct connection.
<br> 

### Video connectors continue to evolve, but common to find 4 types: VGA, DVI, DisplayPort and HDMI.  The last 3 are "digital".
<br>

### "Mini" variants of some of these used primarily in mobile computers.  Example is "Mini-DisplayPort" (thunderbolt)

## More on Connectors 

[Some nice pictures from UC Santa Barbara](https://apps.education.ucsb.edu/wiki/Video_connectors)

* In general, digital output can power analog display input, but not the reverse.

*  This has led to the rise of the Dongle-Indistrial Complex

* Resistance is Futile.  We encourage laptop users to surrender and get more dongles

Our usual source for low-price dongles is [Monoprice](http://www.monoprice.com/)

## USB and Ethernet Connectors

* Universal Serial Bus the most popular way to connect local peripherals

* USB's popularity greatly due to ability to "daisy chain" through USB "hubs".  Hubs may be embedded in other USB peripherals.

* Mobile users with thin devices are most oftem affected by USB port deficits, further feeding the DIC.

## Network Connections

* Typical Ethernet connection in office and home is via an 8-conductor cable with "RJ45" connector.  We call these "patch cords".

* But Ethernet does not always need wires.  So-called "WiFi" is Ethernet over a wireless radio signal.

* While USB can be considered a network in its own right, standards do not exist to carry USB over wireless.

## A Plug for Power Protection

* If uninterrupted function of a computer is required, a UPS (Uninterrubtible Power Supply) is called for. 

* A UPS for every computer is usually not economically feasible, so UPS deployent usually focused on core systems and servers.

* This kind of protection is key to providing the types of remote computing that we'll discuss on Day 3.
