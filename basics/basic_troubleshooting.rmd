## First, the Important Role of "Voodoo"

We use this term to describe actions we commonly take that don't have a very scientific basis, but which oftentimes have a positive effect and that can save a lot of time.

### Application Voodoo

* Is one specific program working poorly?  Close and restart the application.

### System Voodoo

* Are many things not working or computer not usable?  Shutdown the computer and restart/reboot.

## Second, rule out some basics

### Are the computer and monitor getting power?  Check for loose power connections.
<br>
### No video? Check video cable.
<br>
### Suspect something like bad mouse of keyboard? Borrow a different one and try that.
<br>
### Did you recently plug in a new device or peripheral. Disconnect it.


## Reducins the Problem Space

### Does the problem follow *you* or the computer?
