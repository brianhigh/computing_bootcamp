## Answer: You Can't

## I run a firewall. Doesn't that protect me?

### It does protect against external exploits trying to directly connect to your computer.
<br>

### The "threat profile" has changed, and a firewall only covers a small slice of it.

## What is the threat today?
<br>

### The bulk of contenporary threats/exploits depend on an action __inside__ your firewall.
<br>

### The action could be your action or someone else's in your household.

## What do these threats involve?

### They can be a combination of things like:
* Trojans
* Phishing Emails
* Compromised Web Sites
* Keystroke Loggers

### Many of these are now "cross-platform" and exploit weaknesses in things like PDFs, Adobe Acrobat, and Flash

## Some Best Practices:

### "Least Privilege"
<br>

### Do not re-use passwords across sites/services
<br>

### Focus on password quality (not change).
<br>

### Embrace "2FA"
<br>

### Distrust emails by default.

## Phishing

### Run the gamut from cheap and crude to more expensive and sophisticated.
<br>

### Now have evolved from "Phishing" to "Spear Phishing" to "Whaling" and can:
* blanket a wide, nonspecific population 
* blanked a more specific population (like UW)
* target specific individuals or groups of individuals (spear phishing)
* target institutional finances (whaling)
<br>

### Looking for poor grammar may help detect, but is not dependable.
