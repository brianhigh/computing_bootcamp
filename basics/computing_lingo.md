## First, the User Interface
* May be referred to as "UI"
* Add a G for "GUI" to indicate a Graphical User Interface

## Lingo: a bit about “auth”

### Authentication:
* The process of proving that you are who you say you are
* May require multiple “factors”

### Authorization
* The process of checking that you are 	permitted to do what you want.
* Relies on things like group membership 	or bank balance

## Lingo: “Logging In”

### Also known as:
 * “Sign in”
 * “Sign On”

### What's Happening?
	
This is when you authenticate to a computer	system using your "credentials" (most often an ID and a password).

## Lingo: “Logging Out”

### Also known as:
 * “Sign Out”
 * “Sign Off”

### What's Happening?
	
This is when you terminate your authenticated "session" on a computer	system. This is most commonly done with a button in the GUI, but on some systems is achieved by entering a command like "exit".


## Lingo: "Boot" (and "Reboot")

### What's Happening?

 * A "boot" takes a computer that is not turned on and goes through the process of powering the computer, loading its operating systen, identifying attached devices and then bringing it to a point where you can sign on.
 * A "reboot" completes the same process, but it starts from a state where the computer is already turned on and "booted" 
 

## Lingo: "Shut Down"

### Also Known as :
* "Power Down"
* "Power Off"

### What's Happening?

* These synonymous terms refer to when you tell the computer to turn off, most frequently from a shutdown button on the computer screen.  Always best if possible to shut down in this way (through the operating system's user interface) so as to achieve an "orderly" or "safe" shutdown.

## Lingo: "Depower" (rare)

### What's happening?  

* Depowering is what it sounds like: unplugging the computer from its power source. This measure will sometimes bring a computer back from a confused state.

* A good example are the new telephones being installed at UW.  They are in fact small, specialized computers.  If they become confused or otherwise misbehave, the main measure to resolve the problem is to disconnect the phone from the wall jack and then plug it back in to "boot".

## Lingo: "Disconnect"

* Some computers, mainly multi-user servers like our Waldo and HAL, allow a user to disconnect from a remote computer without terminating your authenticated session.  These computers will ask you to re-authenticate when you Reconnect
