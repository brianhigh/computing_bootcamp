## First, Consider Subscribing to eOutage

eOutage is a very low traffic UW Mailman list read *mostly* by technical staff, but which provides pretty clear information when any major campus-wide service is having problems, whether it is network problems or problems with a major application like Office365/Outlook.  Follow the "Join" link at:

### http://www.washington.edu/cac/outages/

## Second, rule out some basics 

### Is yellow patch cord plugged in to wall?

### If connected through new "VoIP" phone, is the phone working?

## Further characterize the problem

### If in the office, are neighbors having the same problem?
This will be key for EHIT to know ASAP

### Does the problem manifest mostly through your browswer?
Try closiny that browser and opening a different one.




### Does the problem follow *you* or the computer?

## But you say you are using __wireless__?
