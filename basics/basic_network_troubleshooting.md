## First, Consider Subscribing to eOutage

eOutage is a very low traffic UW Mailman list read *mostly* by technical staff, but which provides pretty clear information when any major campus-wide service is having problems, whether it is network problems or problems with a major application like Office365/Outlook.  Follow the "Join" link at:

### http://www.washington.edu/cac/outages/

## Second, rule out some basics 
<br>

### Is yellow patch cord plugged in to wall?
<br>

### If connected through new "VoIP" phone, is the phone working?
<br>

### Start checking at the computer,  then work your way out.


## Further characterize the problem

### If in the office, are neighbors having the same problem?
* This will be key for EHIT to know ASAP

### Does the problem manifest mostly through your browswer?
* Try closing that browser and opening a different one.

### Does the problem follow *you* or the computer?

## But you say you are using __wireless__?

### Wireless is convenient but less reliable than wired.

* Our first question is usually "Are you on wireless?"
<br>

### If working on something important or time-sensitve, look for a wired connection.
<br>

### Videoconferencing? Don't use wireless.

## Again, The Browser Factor

### Much of the typical work experience now employs a browser.
<br>

### Many tabs open is typical.
<br>

### Very common to form an impression that the network is slow when it may be just fine.

## UW Network Reliability?

### After some upgrade pains a few years agon, UW wired networking has been very reliable.
