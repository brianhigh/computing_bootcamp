## A Show of Hands:

### Who of us has ever spent an hour looking for a file that in the end **was** found?

### Why was it hard to find?

## Name folders and files as simply and economically as possible

### Can you survive with lower case?
<br>

### Do you need spaces or can dash or underscore suffice?
<br>

### Resist special characters
<br>

### Plan ahead to reduce duplication in names like:
```
\Files\Bob\2006\August_2006\Bob's_Files\2006
```
## Improve Sort Order using YYYYMMDD

### It is the simplest and most widely used date format across document and data management.
<br>

### YYYYMMDD can avoid a lot of data rework and reformatting down the road

## Optimize Folder View

## Is all of this very important?

### Yes, and especially if you are facing the challenges of managing lots of data files.
<br>

### Being able to script and automate depends on it.
