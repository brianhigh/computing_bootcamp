## A Show of Hands:

### Who of us has **never** lost hours of work on some project involving a computer?

## A list of some common hazards:

* Files sent as email attachments.
* Files stored on portable devices like USB thumb drives.
* Files overwritten or deleted by accident.
* Files shared with other parties.
* Files stored on a 3rd-party service.

### Are files really hazards?  No.  They are just what is at risk

## Hazard: A file sent as an email attachment

### Example: a file is opened by double-clicking, worked on for 4-5 hours and then completely lost.

### What Happened? The file was never **really** saved, even though the editor hit "Save"
