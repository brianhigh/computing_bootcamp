## A Show of Hands:

### Who of us has **never** lost hours of work on some project involving a computer?

## A list of some common hazards:

* Files sent as email attachments.
* Files stored on portable devices like USB thumb drives.
* Files overwritten or deleted by accident.
* Files stored on a 3rd-party service.

### Are files really hazards?  No.  They are just what is at risk.

## Hazard: A file sent as an email attachment

### Example: Bob opened the file from email by double-clicking, worked on it for 4-5 hours, but then lost all of his changes.
<br>

### Why? The file was never **really** saved, even though Bob hit "Save"
<br>

### How to avoid? **Save files in explicit locations before starting work**
<br>

## Control-S is your friend!

### Most editing software implements the simple, easy-to-use key combination.

## Doesn't "AutoSave" do that?

### Autosave isn't all that "Auto".
<br>

### If you first saved a file explicitly, and then the power failed or your computer crashed, it may help.
<br>

###No Save, No Auto!

## Hazard: Portable Storage like USB Thumb Drives

### They get lost easily
<br>

### They stop working unexpectedly (and frequently).
<br>

### What to do? Make sure important stuff is moved to a second location -- a system that is robust and has backups.

## Hazard:  Files overwritten or deleted by accident.

### It happens, so how to avoid and/or recover?
<br>

### Use meaningfule file names with a versioning component
<br>

### Keep files on a storage system that has backup and that supports "snapshots".  In DEOHS, that is "Pacific".
<br>

### Consider using version control (Git).

## Hazard: Files stored on a 3rd-party service.

### Bigger 3rd-party "cloud" storage services can be pretty robust. But don't be unprepared for the occasional outage.
<br>

### Make sure you understand how service features like synchronization and sharing work.
<br>

### Regardless, you need to have your important files in at least 2 places.
