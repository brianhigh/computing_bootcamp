## First an Example Network (Ours):

## A Farther Look with Some Terms:

![](../images/network_layout_400x360.png)<br><br>

* **LAN**, or **Local**-Area Network<br><br>
* **WAN**, or **Wide**-Area Network<br><br>
* **Subnet**, a broader term describing logical subdivisions of a network




## Some Important Addresses

Your computer has various addresses to allow routing of network traffic to and from your computer.

### Hardware (MAC) address 
* A non-routable numeric hardware/physical address assigned to your "network interface card" or "NIC"
* an example: 26:a5:b7:20:f0:35

### Internet (IP) Address  
* the routable numeric Internet (logical) address assigned to your NIC.
* an example: 128.95.230.32
* This form shows the address under Internet Protocol version 4
* A newer version -- IPv6 -- is slowly supplanting version 4, but this should not concern you.

## More about IP Addresses

* This form (128.95.230.32) shows the address under Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4).
* A newer version -- IPv6 -- is slowly supplanting version 4, but this should not concern you.

## Mapping Internet Names to Numbers

### Host Name ("hostname") 
* the character-based name assigned to your numeric Internet (IP) address
* often used in short form, like "phage" 
* effective use in networking relies on the "fully qualified" name. example: phage.deohs.washington.edu

### This Depends on what is perhaps the world's largest phonebook:  **The Domain Name System**
