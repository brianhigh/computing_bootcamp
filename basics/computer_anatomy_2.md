## More Anatomy 

Other common elements of, or accessories to, general-purpose computers include

* Input Devices (keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, scanner, microphone)

* Output Devices (screen/display, speakers, printer)

* Some devices may combine both input and output on a single physical connection

## Video Displays and Connectors

### Mutiple displays possible within certain limits.  Each display requires a distinct connection.
<br> 

### Video connectors continue to evolve, but common to find 4 types: VGA, DVI, DisplayPort and HDMI.  The last 3 are "digital".
<br>

### "Mini" variants of some of these used primarily in mobile computers.  Example is "Mini-DisplayPort" (thunderbolt)

* In general, digital output can power analog display input, but not the reverse.

*  This has led to the rise of the Dongle-Indistrial Complex

* Resistance is Futile.  We encourage laptop users to surrender and get more dongles
