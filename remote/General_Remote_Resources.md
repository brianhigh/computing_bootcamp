## General Benefits

- Security
    - Data is stored in a physically secure location
- Scalability
    - Compared to typical laptop and desktop computers
- Portability
    - Available anywhere you have internet access

## Storage Benefits

- Sharing data with a group
    - Remote storage is accessible to multiple users with access controls
- Redundant
    - Unlike typical laptop or desktop computers, remote storage services typically have redundant hardware to prevent data loss from hardware failure
- Backups
    - Most storage services use point in time backups. Enabling you to restore your files to an earlier time.

## Remote Desktop Benefits

- Access to different operating systems
    - Your laptop could be a Mac, but you can access the desktop of a Windows or Linux system with a few clicks
- Better Performance
    - Remote systems are often more powerful than most desktop or laptop computers
- Software Licensing
    - Per-user licenses for a server are sometimes cheaper than buying a license for every desktop or laptop you'll use

## Database Benefits

- Sharing data with others
    - A remote database is always on, and up to date. No need to exchange copies of a database between people.
- More reliable than desktop software
    - Database servers are built to work, and handle growing data needs. Most desktop database applications start to lose reliability as the demand placed on them increases.
- Not limited by your operating system
    - Most databases support ODBC or a similar interface. The server doesn't need to be running the same OS as your computer.
