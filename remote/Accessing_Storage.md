## Locating Files

**H: Drive or My Documents**

- Navigate to the path /misc/PROJECT

# Thoughts and Questions

## Thoughts

- For pure file transfers, SFTP via vector is secure and reliable
- With large files, it's better to edit them remotely via Remote Desktop or X2Go
- Remote Desktop offers better data security, by leaving the files securely on the server
