# Concerns

## General Concerns

- Who has access to the data?
- Where is your data (physically)?
- Are you using an encrypted service or protocol?

## Working via Wireless

- Public wireless typically lacks encryption
- Unencrypted wireless networks are easily spoofed
- Your computer could be exposed to other wireless users

## Mitigation Methods

- Ensure you are using an encrypted protocol
    - SFTP (SSH)
    - HTTPS
    - Remote Desktop
- When possible use a secure wireless network
    - Mobile Hotspot
    - Eduroam
- Research the service you are using
    - Do they have an agreement with UW?
    - Have they recently been in the media for security problems?
- Secure your computer
    - Make sure the firewall is enabled
    - Ensure your software is up to date
