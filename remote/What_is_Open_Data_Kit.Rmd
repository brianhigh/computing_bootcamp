# How does it work?

## On Campus

- Create forms for data collection
- All data is aggregated on a server
- Information can be exported
    - CSV
    - JSON
    - Visualized (in browser)

## In the Field

- Data collection using mobile devices (Android)
    - Mobile phones
    - Tablets
- A mobile data connection is not required
    - Data is uploaded via wifi (or mobile) when convenient
- Easy to use
    - Step by step forms walk you through it
    
# Alternatives, and Final Thoughts

## Alternatives

- REDCap
    - Web based application
    - Mobile app for iPad and Android
- Custom built solution
    - Can be expensive to do right
    - Who will maintain it?
- Paper forms
    - Bulky for large studies
    - Greater chance of data entry errors
    
## Final Thoughts

- ODK is easy to use, but limited to Android
     - If iPad support is required, consider REDCap
- Custom built solutions may offer a superior experience, but at a significant premium
- Before making a commitment, be sure to consider your data security requirements
