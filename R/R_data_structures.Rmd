## Learning Objectives

You will learn:

* The basic "higher order" data structures in R
* How to create categorical variables in R
* How to convert a data object from one structure to another

## Basic Multi-Value (Composite) Structures

R has four basic "composite" data structures for containing multiple data 
values or objects:

Name            | Dimension |Composition
----------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------
(Atomic) Vector | 1 | Made of scalar items of the same type (homogenous)
Matrix          | 2 | Made from an atomic vector and the number of rows and columns
Array           | n | Made from an atomic vector and a vector of dimension lengths
List            | 1 | A vector made of scalar or composite items (heterogeneous)

These are used in R to make more complex data objects.

For example, the most commonly used data structure is the "Data frame", based on 
the "List". Likewise, the "Data table" object is based on the "Data frame".

## Summary of Basic Data Structures

## Vector

A vector is a one-dimensional group (collection) of one or more values 
(data elements), all of the same ("homogenous") single-valued data type 
(i.e. "atomic").

```{r}
vec <- 1234   # A vector containing a single value
```

The `c()` function "combines" values into a vector.

```{r}
vec <- c(12, 34)
vec
is.vector(vec)
```

## Vector

Vectors in R are called "atomic vectors" because they are a "flat" structure 
composed only of single-valued items.

```{r}
length(vec)
is.atomic(vec)
```

## Vector

We can save ourselves some typing when working with sequences of integers. 
These are all ways to create equivalent vectors of the digits one through four:

```{r}
c(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L)
1:4
seq(1, 4)         # Type ?seq to find out how to make more complex sequences.
```

## Vector

R will try to "coerce" the values of a vector to a common data type, if necessary.

```{r}
c('a', 1)                # Coerced to "character"
c(1L, 1.1)               # Coerced to "double"
c(1L, 1.1, 1+1i)         # Coerced to "complex"
c('a', 1L, 1.1, 1+1i)    # Coerced to "character"
```

## Matrix

A Matrix is a two-dimensional structure of values, all of the same data type. 
It can be constructed from a Vector, as supplied by the "data" argument for the 
`matrix()` function.

```{r}
mat <- matrix(data = 1:4, nrow = 2)
mat
```

You can also arrange the values by row instead of by column.

```{r}
mat <- matrix(data = 1:4, nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
mat
```

## Underlying Data Structure

Several functions may be used to expose the underlying data structure.

```{r}
str(mat)         # int ...    (a 2x2 structure of the integers 1 through 4)
typeof(mat)      # "integer"  (the data type of the primitive elements)
class(mat)       # "matrix"   (the higher order data structure)
attributes(mat)  # $dim ...   (the metadata for the object, related to its class)
```

## Array

An Array is a multi-dimensional structure of values, all of the same data type.

```{r}
arr.data <- seq(5, 120, 5)    # A vector of length 24
arr.dim <- c(3, 4, 2)         # The product of the these three values is 24
arr3d <- array(data = arr.data, dim = arr.dim)
arr3d
```

This array was built from a single data vector, but split into three dimensions.

## Array

```{r}
typeof(arr3d)      # "double"
mode(arr3d)        # "numeric"
str(arr3d)         # num ...
class(arr3d)       # "array"
```

## List

A list is a vector of data objects which may be heterogenous (non-atomic).

```{r}
lst3d <- list(x=1:3, y=letters[1:4], z=LETTERS[1:2])
lst3d
is.atomic(lst3d)
```

This list was built from three vectors, which were labeled "x", "y", and "z". 

## List

```{r}
typeof(lst3d)    # list (does not show underlying data type since it may vary)
class(lst3d)     # list (same as result of typeof function)
```

The "class" of the list is shown in the first line of `str()` output. 

```{r}
str(lst3d)
```

## Lists and Dimensions

Earlier, we said that a list is one dimensional. Then we created a 
"multidimensional" list. What's going on here? Let's compare with our array.

```{r}
dim(arr3d)             # 3 4 2 (Array has three dimensions of these lengths.)
dim(lst3d)             # NULL (List is only one dimension -- as far as it knows.)
```

So, while we can store several layers of data representing several dimensions
in a list, the list structure is merely a storage container. It does not
provide the functionality of a `matrix` or `array` to allow for multidimensional
operations on the data it contains. Think of a `list` as a one-dimensional 
*container* allowing for a *nested* structure of varying depth.

## Lists and Attributes

If we compare the `attributes`, we see that the `array` stores a vector of
dimension lengths. However, the `list` does not store any information about 
the structure of it's elements.

```{r}
attributes(arr3d)      # $dim ... Array dimension lengths stored as an attribute.
attributes(lst3d)      # $names ... List item names stored as an attribute.
```

And a list does not need to have any attributes at all...

```{r}
attributes(list(1:4))  # NULL
```

## Naming Array Dimensions with a List

Now that we know about lists, we can see one in action.

```{r}
arr3d.named <- array(data = arr.data, dim = arr.dim, dimnames = lst3d)
arr3d.named
```

We used our list to define the item names for each dimension of the array.

## Data frame

A Data frame is a multi-dimensional structure of values, allowing multiple data
types. It is implemented as a list. A data frame is used like a database table 
to store and manipulate tabular data in rows ("observations") and columns 
("variables"). You can think of the columns as vectors, since the values in a 
column must be of the same type.


```{r}
df <- data.frame(number=1:4, letter=letters[1:4])
df
```

## Data frame

```{r}
typeof(df)     # list, same as mode(df)
dim(df)        # This "list" has multiple dimensions!
str(df)
```

We see that our data frame is stored as a list, but it's class has additional
attributes which allow it to function as a two dimensional object.

## Data frame

By default, "character" values are converted to "factors" (categorical 
variables). We can change this behavior with `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(number=1:4, letter=letters[1:4], stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
df
```

And we can hide the row numbers using `print()` with `row.names = FALSE`.

```{r}
print(df, row.names = FALSE)
```

## Data frame

We can see that our list, `lst3d`, has a different class than our data frame, `df`.

```{r}
class(lst3d)     # list
class(df)        # data.frame
```

Although a data frame is implemented as a list, it has additional properties 
which make it very useful for data analysis. Those properties are associated
with the data frame's "class". As before, `typeof()` shows the lower order 
data type and `class()` shows the higher order data type.

## Factors

We stumbled upon the topic of "factors" (categorical variables) when we created 
a data frame from a character vector. Let's create one and explore it's properties.

```{r}
gender <- factor(c('m', 'm', 'f', 'm', 'f', 'f'))
gender
class(gender)
```

This looks like a character vector with the additional attribute of "Levels", 
where the levels are the unique values from the vector. But how is this implemented?

## Factors

```{r}
typeof(gender)
str(gender)
attributes(gender)
```

As we can see, a factor in R is an object of class "factor" composed of an 
integer vector and a `$class` attribute and a `$levels` attribute containing a 
character vector.

## Factors

Factors can also represent ordinal variables, but you need to be careful when 
using ordered factors to make sure the order is correct.

```{r}
risk <- c('medium', 'high', 'low', 'low', 'medium', 'low', 'high')
factor(risk, ordered = TRUE)                # Factors in alpha-numeric order

severity <- c('low', 'medium', 'high')      # Factors by increasing severity
risk <- factor(risk, ordered = TRUE, levels = severity)
risk

# Create a data frame using this risk factor variable
risky <- data.frame(id = LETTERS[1:7], risk, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

## Data Structure Conversion

We can create a matrix from two dimensions of a 3D array using the `matrix()`
constructor we have used previously. However, it may not behave as you expect.

```{r}
arr2d.named <- arr3d.named[,,1]   # Subset before converting (just two dimensions)
attributes(arr2d.named)           # A 3x4 array with dimension names
m1 <- matrix(arr2d.named)         # Flattened. Same as:  matrix(as.vector(arr_2d))
attributes(m1)                    # A 12x1 matrix without dimension names -- surprise!
```

## Data Structure Conversion

We can also use "as" functions to convert higher order data structures.

Let's use the `as.matrix()` converter to create the matrix from the array.

```{r}
m2 <- as.matrix(arr2d.named)      # Not flattened. Dimensions and names are retained.
attributes(m2)
```

Note the difference between the `matrix()` constructor and the `as.matrix()`
converter. The dimension and name attributes have been retained when using
the converter function. Which approach you choose will depend on whether or not
you prefer to flatten or retain the structure and attributes of the original 
object. It will also depend on the types of objects you are using. (Try 
this with a data frame.)
