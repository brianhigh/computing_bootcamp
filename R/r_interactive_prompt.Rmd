## Learning Objectives

You will learn:

* Where to find the R prompt
* How the prompt works
* Keyboard Shortcuts
* How to Restart R

## The Prompt is in the Console

The interactive R prompt is usually found or starting within a "console". 

* In RStudio, you have a Console pane. 
* In other applications, you have a Terminal window of some sort.
* The features vary, but this is mostly a text-only interface.
* That means, the mouse is only good for cursor location and copy/cut/paste.

## How the Prompt Works

* The prompt waits for commands
* You type a command at the prompt and press *Enter* (or *Return*)
* R will parse your commands and try follow them
* R will either show an error, show results, or silently complete the task

## Keyboard Shortcuts

It pays to know keyboard shortcuts to minimize use of the mouse.

* Select text: Press *Shift* and move left or right with arrow keys
* Select entire line: *Ctrl-a* or *Cmd-a* (Mac) 
* Copy selected text: *Ctrl-c* or *Cmd-c* (Mac)
* Cut selected text: *Ctrl-x* or *Cmd-x* (Mac)
* Paste text from clipboard: *Ctrl-v* or *Cmd-v* (Mac)
* Move to beginning of line: *Home* or *Cmd*-*Left Arrow* (Mac)
* Move to end of the line: *End* or *Cmd*-*Right Arrow* (Mac)
* Traversing the line by character: *Left Arrow* and *Right Arrow*
* Traversing your command history: *Up* and *Down* arrow keys
* Scrolling up and down through the Console screen: *PgUp* and *PgDn*

There are a [bunch more](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts) of these. Over time, the savings in effort add up!

## Restarting R

If R get's stuck, or you would just like to start with a fresh R session 
(to clear variables and packages), try...

In RStudio's Console pane:

* From the menu: Session -> Restart R
* With a keyboard shortcut: Cmd/Ctrl - Shift - F10
* With an R comand: `.rs.restartR()`

In any R console:

* Quit the session with `q()` (or from the menu) and start a new session
* Close the window and launch a new one (you might lose work, though)
