## Modular Programming: Functions and Packages

You will learn:

* How to modularize your code
* How to write functions in R
* How to create and share your own R packages

## User-defined functions

We can store a [BMI calculation](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html) 
in a `function`, which is an R object which can perform a series of operations upon data.

```{r}
calcBMI <- function(wt.lb, ht.in) { (wt.lb / ht.in ^ 2) * 703 }
```

Now we can use our function to perform this calculation whenever we need to.

```{r}
weight <- c(159.2, 162.3, 203.5, 181.3)
height <- c(68.1, 69.4, 71.2, 68.9)
calcBMI(weight, height)
```

By placing commonly-used code in functions, we make our programs more modular,
allowing for code reuse and cleaner, clearer, more maintainable code.

Taking this a step further, we can also create our own *packages* to store and
share functions, documentation, and example data.

This approach is called *modular programming*.

## Creating Packages

It is not difficult to create our own packages and to share them. Here is the 
absolute minimum of steps needed to create a very "bare bones" package.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create the package name from the system username to minimize conflicts
pkg.name <- paste(Sys.info()['user'], '.', 'bmi', sep = '')

# Create the "bmi" package folder and the "R" subfolder
dir.create(file.path(pkg.name, 'R'), showWarnings = FALSE, recursive = TRUE)

# Create an R script containing just the function definition
sink(file.path(pkg.name, 'R', 'calcBMI.R'))
cat('calcBMI <- function(wt.lb, ht.in) { (wt.lb / ht.in ^ 2) * 703 }', sep = '\n')
sink()

sink(file.path(pkg.name, 'DESCRIPTION'))    # Create a DESCRIPTION text file
cat(paste('Package:', pkg.name), sep = '\n')
cat('Version: 0.1', sep = '\n', append = TRUE)
sink()

sink(file.path(pkg.name, 'NAMESPACE'))      # Create a NAMESPACE text file
cat('export(calcBMI)', sep = '\n')
sink()

library(devtools)
build(pkg.name, quiet = TRUE)               # Build the package
```

## Creating Packages

We can install the "bmi" package we just built and verify that it installed.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install(pkg.name)                     # Install the package
unlink(pkg.name, recursive = TRUE)    # Remove the temporary build folder
packageDescription(pkg.name)          # View package description to confirm
```

If we see a listing of the package description, then the package has been 
installed okay. Now we can load the package and use the function it contains.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(pkg.name, character.only = TRUE)
calcBMI(150, 70)                      # Expected result:  21.52041
```

If we get the expected result then the package works okay.

Now we can unload the package and uninstall it.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
detach(pos=grep(pkg.name, search()), unload = TRUE)
remove.packages(pkg.name)             # Remove package when done with example
```

## Creating Packages

Next, we will expand on our BMI example by adding documentation (help files) to 
provide a more complete picture of this process.

## Creating Packages with Documentation

We will be using some additional packages to make the task of generating 
the package files and documentation easier.

First, install the packages if you don't already have them.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "knitr"))
```

Then load the packages.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("devtools")
library("roxygen2")
library("knitr")
```

## Create the Package Directory

We will construct our package name from our user name as before.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create the package name from the system username to minimize conflicts
pkg.name <- paste(Sys.info()['user'], '.', 'bmi', sep = '')
```

Then will remove the temporary build folder, if it exists from previous work.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Remove the build folder if it exists
unlink(pkg.name, recursive = TRUE)    # Remove the temporary build folder
```

Then we can use the `create()` function to create the package directory and
file templates.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create the package directory and file templates
create(pkg.name)
```

## Create Custom DESCRIPTION File

While the `create()` has already created a DESCRIPTION file, we will replace it
with our own custom version. This could be done manually with a text editor.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
description <- 
"Title: BMI Calculator
Description: Calculates the BMI given weight in pounds and height in inches
Author: Your Name Here <your.name@example.com>
Maintainer: Your Name Here <your.name@example.com>
Depends: R (>= 3.3.1)
License: MIT
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
"

sink(file.path(pkg.name, 'DESCRIPTION'))
cat(paste('Package:', pkg.name), sep = '\n')
cat('Version: 0.1', sep = '\n', append = TRUE)
cat(paste('Date:', format(Sys.time(), "%Y-%m-%d")), sep = '\n', append = TRUE)
cat(description)
sink()
```

## Create R Function Files

With the *roxygen2* package, we can embed documention in our R script using
the `#'` notation.

Again, we could do this manually, but have scripted it here for reproducibility.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my.function <- 
"#' BMI calculator
#'
#' Calculates the BMI given weight in pounds and height in inches
#' @param wt.lbs Weight in pounds
#' @param ht.in Height in inches
#' @keywords bmi
#' @export
#' @examples
#' calcBMI(150, 70)  # Expected result:  21.52041 

calcBMI <- function(wt.lb, ht.in) { (wt.lb / ht.in ^ 2) * 703 }
"

sink(file.path(pkg.name, 'R', 'calcBMI.R'))
cat(my.function)
sink()
```

## Generate Documentation

The `document()` function will create the `man/calcBMI.Rd` file, which is used
in the R help system to display the `help()` and `example()` results.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
setwd(pkg.name)
document()
setwd("..")
```

## Install Package and Test Help

We install the package using `install()` and load with `library()` as before.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install(pkg.name)
library(pkg.name)
```

Now that we have documentation, we can test them with `help()` and `example()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
help(calcBMI)
example(calcBMI)
```

## Send the Package to Github

If you have a Github account and have already created a repository (repo) for 
this package, you can send the package to the repo for others to use.

Here are commands to type at the Bash prompt to send a package to
Github.

```{r, engine="bash", eval=FALSE}
cd high.bmi
git init
echo 'high.bmi.Rproj' >> .gitignore
git add .
git commit -m 'First commit'
git remote add origin https://github.com/brianhigh/high.bmi.git
git push -u origin master
cd ..
```

Of course, you would replace `high.bmi` with your own package name and 
`brianhigh` with your own Github account name.

Note: The repository name must match the package name.

## Installing the Package from Github

Now anyone with access to your Github repo can install your package.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("devtools")
install_github('brianhigh/high.bmi')
library(high.bmi)
```

## Publishing your Package on CRAN

Sites like [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org) 
are the "big time". You will need to do additional work to include your package 
in those repositories. 

We don't have time to cover that topic today, so we will point you in the
direction of some helpful resources:

* [Releasing a package](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/release.html) by Hadley Wickham
* [Getting your R package on CRAN](http://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/pages/cran.html) by Karl Broman
* [Developing R packages](https://github.com/jtleek/rpackages) by Jeff Leek
* [Bioconductor Package Submission](https://www.bioconductor.org/developers/package-submission/)

## Unload and Remove Package

Now that we are done with the package example, we can remove the build folder
and the package from our system.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
detach(pos=grep(pkg.name, search()), unload = TRUE)
remove.packages(pkg.name)             # Remove package when done with example
unlink(pkg.name, recursive = TRUE)    # Remove the temporary build folder
```
