What is your primary role in DEOHS?
How would you describe your R usage over the past year?
Have you ever written an R script?
Have you ever used another programming language other than R?
What do you hope to get out of this class?
Would you like to be added to our discussion group deohs-informatics@u.washington.edu where we discuss R and other data science topics (like R) within our department?
