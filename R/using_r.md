## Learning Objectives

You will learn:

* What R is (and isn't)
* Why you might choose R over the alternatives
* How to use R
* How to Avoid R while Using R

## What is R?

* R is a cross-platform software **_application_** for data analysis and visualization
* R is **_free_** to use, **_free_** to share, and **_free_** to modify
* R is a programming **_language_** with over 10,000 user-contributed packages
* R is an open source and **_community_**-driven software development **_project_**

## What R Isn't

* R is not a point-and-click software application (though some are available for R)
* R is not a proprietary commercial product (though some do sell it)
* R is not something you can master in a day (or a week, or a month)

## Why you might choose R

* You would like to use a free and popular statistics application
* You would like support from a very helpful community of thousands of users 
* You would like to use code or packages which are only available in R
* You would like to generate quality graphics for publication
* You would like to use a system which supports data analysis "best practices"
* You would like an end-to-end solution for reproducible data analysis
* You would like work with "Big Data" and your current tools are not sufficient

## How to use R

* Choose a version of R 
    - and (optionally) an R graphical user interface (GUI)
* Download R from the Internet
    - and GUI, other tools, etc.
* Install the R application
* Configure R (if necessary)
* Locate the built-in help resources
* Install R Packages
* Type R commands at the interactive prompt (console)
* Save commands in an R script file and run this script
* Import data, process it with R commands, produce plots, and save results
* Get online help
* Learn how to do more with R

## How to Avoid R while Using R

If you would like to use R (by using a point-and-click GUI application) and 
would also like to minimize or avoid writing R code, try one of these:

* [R-Commander](http://www.rcommander.com/) ([Rcmdr](http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/))
* [Deducer](www.deducer.org)
* [Rattle](http://rattle.togaware.com/)
* [R AnalyticFlow](http://r.analyticflow.com/en/)
* [GraphR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GrapheR/index.html)

We will not be spending any time with these in this course, however. Sorry.
