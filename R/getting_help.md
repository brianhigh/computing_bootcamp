## Our Favorite Online R Courses

### Roger Peng on YouTube (free)

For those who have not used R before and would like an excellent introduction to R by Roger Peng. These [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiKxy5IecUw&list=PLycnP7USbo1XGmTeFAAzr79e8V7zr7Ccx) are from a 2012 online course _Introduction to Data Science with R_. See also: [Coursera Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) with Roger Peng, Jeff Leek, and Brian Caffo. And: [R Programming for Data Science](https://leanpub.com/rprogramming) by Roger Peng.

### Barton Poulson on Lynda.com

You might prefer to watch (the somewhat gentler and more polished) Lynda.com course: [Up and Running with R](http://www.lynda.com/R-tutorials/Up-Running-R/120612-2.html). Appropriate for total beginners to programming and to R. About 2-1/2 hours of video. You can watch for free through Seattle Public Library (SPL) if have a [library card](http://www.spl.org/using-the-library/get-started/get-a-library-card). Login to Lynda.com [through SPL](https://ezproxy.spl.org/login?url=http://lynda.com/portal/sip?org=spl.org) to gain access. See also: [R Statistics Essential Training](https://www.lynda.com/R-tutorials/R-Statistics-Essential-Training/142447-2.html), also by Barton Poulson (6 hours). 

### DataCamp (free with registration)

Free 2-hour course: [R for the Intimidated](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/r-for-the-intimidated) by Annika Salzberg.

## Our Favorite Online R Tutorials

### CodeSchool's Try-R

You do not need to "register" or create an account to run the tutorial. This tutorial is aimed at first-time R users. ([Try-R](http://tryr.codeschool.com/))

### Swirl tutorials

See if you can get through all 15 segments of the "R Programming: The basics of programming in R" course. ([Swirl](http://swirlstats.com/students.html),
[Swirl Guide](https://github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/A-very-short-introduction-to-R/blob/master/documents/Using%20swirl%20to%20practise%20R.pdf)) Use the alternative version, "R Programming Alt". Install it like this:


```r
install.packages("swirl")
library(swirl)
install_from_swirl("R Programming Alt")
swirl()
```

## R Books: UW-licensed eBooks

These are available at no cost to [UW](https://www.lib.washington.edu/) students, 
staff, or faculty. The links we have provided (for the title text) are to the 
UW-licenced copy. There are many more R books available through the UW, but these
are some of our favorites.

- [Beginning Data Science with R](http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71215329450001451) by Manas A. Pathak (View online or download.) Intended for readers who have previously learned at least one other programming language.
- [Using R and RStudio for data management, statistical analysis, and graphics](http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71226299210001451)  by Nicholas J. Horton and Ken Kleinman. A reference of short examples of how you might do various tasks (like a cookbook), with longer case studies at the end.
- [A Primer in Biological Data Analysis and Visualization Using R](http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71204319410001451) by Gregg Hartvigsen. Takes a much slower and thorough tour of R and its use for data analysis -- for absolute beginners.
- [R in a Nutshell](http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71155074480001451) by Joseph Adler, M.Eng. This is an excellent reference, especially for those with a background in programming. There is a [second edition out](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022008.do) now, but the UW does not have access to it.
- [Introduction to data analysis and graphical presentation in biostatistics with R : statistics in the large](http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71197447610001451) by Thomas W. MacFarland. (View online or download.)
- [Introductory statistics with R](http://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/UW:all:CP71130982630001451) by Peter Dalgaard. (View online or download.)

## More of Our Favorite R Books

The [UW](https://www.lib.washington.edu/) has all of these (in print editions) and the Seattle Public Library ([SPL](http://www.spl.org/))
has two of these as eBooks through O'Reilly's Safari website. Seattle residents
may obtain a free SPL [library card](http://www.spl.org/using-the-library/get-started/get-a-library-card) to gain access to these eBooks. The title text
has been linked to the publisher's website for each book.
