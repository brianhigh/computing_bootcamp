## R Language Basics

## Accessing Data

If you just enter a value, R will print it out:

```{r}
1
'a'
```

You can store data in memory by assigning values to variables.

```{r}
a <- 1
a
```

## Comments

The `#` is used for comments. Everthing after the `#` will be ignored by R.

```{r}
a    # This is a bad name for a variable.
```

The `#` symbol often is called:

* number sign
* pound sign
* hash (Popular with programmers.)
* hashtag (Technically, this refers to a number sign and the text following it.)
* octothorpe (This term originated at Bell Labs, possibly as a "joke".)

## Data Types

The most basic data types are `numeric` (`double` and `integer`), `complex`, 
and `character`. You can view the type of a value with the `typeof()` function:

```{r}
typeof(1)       # "double" -- double precision floating point number
typeof(1L)      # "integer" -- "L" after one or more digits makes it an integer
typeof(1 + 2i)  # "complex" -- a number with real and imaginary components
```

## Character Data Type

Characters are entered with quotes around them (single or double quotes).

```{r}
typeof('a')     # "character" -- a non-numeric "string" of text characters
```

If you omit the quotes of an alphanumeric string, R will assume you are 
referring to a variable name.

```{r}
a <- 1
typeof(a)
```

## Displaying Data Type

You can show the type of a value with typeof()

```{r}
typeof(1)
typeof('a')
```

## Type Conversion

You can change the type of a value:

```{r}
typeof(as.integer(1))
```

If you have several values of different types, some may be converted for you:

```{r}
a <- c('a', 'b', 1, 2)
a
typeof(a)
```

## Testing for Numeric Values

You can test if a value is numeric using the `is.numeric()` function:

```{r}
is.numeric(1)
is.numeric(1L)
is.numeric(1 + 2i)
```

## Testing for Numeric Values

As before, we quote literal character strings but not variable names.

```{r}
is.character('a')
a <- 1
is.character(a)
```

## Data Structures

R has four basic data structures:

* Vector
* Matrix
* Array
* List
* Dataframe

## Vector

The default data structure is a Vector. A vector is a two-dimensional group 
(collection) of one or more values (data elements).

```{r}
a <- 1
```

The `c()` function "concatenates" values into a vector.

```{r}
a <- c(1, 2)
a
is.vector(a)
```

## Vector

Vectors may contain values of more than one data type.

```{r}
a <- c('a', 'b', 1, 2)
a
is.vector(a)
```

## Sequences of Integers

We can save ourselves some typing when working with sequences of integers. 
These are all ways to create equivalent vectors of the digits one through four:

```{r}
c(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L)
1:4
seq(1:4)
```

## Matrix

A Matrix is a two-dimensional structure of values, all of the same data type.

```{r}
m <- matrix(data = 1:4, nrow = 2)
m
```

You can also arrange the values by row instead of by column.

```{r}
m <- matrix(data = 1:4, nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
m
```

## Underlying structure and "class"

The `str()` function may be used to show the underlying data structure.

```{r}
str(m)
```

This shows that we have a 2x2 structure of the integers 1 through 4.

We can also display the class with the `class()` function:

```{r}
class(m)
```

So, the 2x2 structure is stored as a `matrix`.

## Array

An Array is a multi-dimensional structure of values, all of the same data type.

```{r}
a <- array(data = 1:8, dim = c(2, 2, 2))
a
```

## Array

```{r}
typeof(a)
str(a)
class(a)
```

## List

A List is a multi-dimensional structure of values, allowing multiple data
types.

```{r}
x <- list(a = 1:3, b = c('i', 'j', 'k'))
x
```

## List

```{r}
typeof(x)
str(x)
```

The "class" of the list is shown in the first line of `str()` output. 

```{r}
class(x)
```

## Dataframe

A Dataframe is a multi-dimensional structure of values, allowing multiple data
types. It is implemented as a list.

```{r}
y <- data.frame(a = 1:3, b = c('i', 'j', 'k'))
y
```

## Dataframe

```{r}
typeof(y)
str(y)
```

## Dataframe

By default, "character" values are converted to "factors". We can change this
behavior with the `stringsAsFactors` option.

```{r}
y <- data.frame(a = 1:3, b = c('i', 'j', 'k'), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
y
```

## Dataframe

```{r}
typeof(y)
str(y)
```

## Dataframe

We can see that our list, `x`, has a different class than our dataframe, `y`.

```{r}
class(x)
class(y)
```

Although a dataframe is implemented as a list, it has additional properties 
which make it very useful for data analysis. Those properties are associated
with the dataframe's "class".
