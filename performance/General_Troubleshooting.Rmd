## Computer Won't Boot

**Blank Screen and No Signs of Life**

- Make sure all the power cords and cables are securely connected.
- Make sure the surge protector is on. Try resetting it, and turning it on.

**Powers on, says Invalid Disk**

- Disconnect any external drives (USB sticks and hard drives), then power it back on
- During boot up, you should see an option to run diagnostics. That will check the hard drive for failure.

**Fans running, monitor is asleep or off**

- Check cables to monitor, and make sure they are connected
- Try the buttons on the monitor to see if the screen wakes up.
    - If it does, try cycling through the input choices.

## User Profile Issues

**Profile Over Quota**

- Files reappearing
- Documents on desktop don't appear on other computers
- Login and logout take a long time

**Causes**

- Dropbox and other cloud tools by default store everything in your profile
- Your Downloads folder is part of your profile. It needs to be cleaned up perdiocally.

**Fixes**

- Move your Dropbox (or similar tool) storage to somewhere like C:\john_dropbox
- Clean out your Downloads folder
- Request a profile reset (sometimes needed)

## Generic Problems

**Devices**

- Make sure they are connected securely
- If external power is needed, check the power supply

**Odd Behavior**

- Have you rebooted recently? Try rebooting.
- Has the application changed? Perhaps it was updated.
- Is anyone else seeing similar problems?
