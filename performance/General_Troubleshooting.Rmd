## Things to Check

- Is it plugged in securely?
- Try it on a different computer
- Does anyone else have a similar problem?
- Have you rebooted lately?
- Anything different? (USB device plugged in, etc)
- Has the application changed? (the default program may have changed)
- Is your user profile too big?
