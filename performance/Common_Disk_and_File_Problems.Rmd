## Common Problems

**Disk**

- Unrecognized disk format
- Device isn't recognized
- File is missing

**File**

- Unable to open file
- Application crashes when viewing file

## Physical Disk Problems

- Are any status lights on?
    - Make sure any required external power supply is connected and on
    - Make sure there isn't a second power switch somewhere on the unit
- Damage to connector or cable
    - If the cable is detachable, try a different one
    - If the damage is to the device itself, seek help
- Grinding or squeaking nose
    - The drive is most likely failing (unless it has a fan making the noise)
    - Turn off the drive, and seek help before further damage occurs.

## Disk File System Issues 

- Computer asks to format disk
    - Try it on a computer with a different operating system, disk formats aren't 100% universal
- Files are missing
    - The file system may be damaged, tools like Recuva and TestDisk may recover the data

## File Problems

- Office crashes when opening a Word document
    - Try opening the file with LibreOffice, and then saving the file with a new name
- Double-clicking on the file doesn't open it
    - Open the application that you wish to use, and try using File > Open
- File appears to contain garbage data
    - Make sure the application you opened it with, actually supports the format
    - The file may be damaged, and require restoration from backup
