## Where can bottlenecks exist?

- Human (User)
- Software
- Computing Resources

## How are they slowing you down?

**Human**

- Insufficient Training
- Not enough people to do the task
- Task may be limited to one person, and they're as fast as possible

**Software**

- Unoptimized code
- Poor usability (slowing down user)
- Wrong tool for the job

**Computing Resources**

- Insufficient CPU
- Lack of memory (RAM)
- Slow storage

## Determining if a Bottleneck Exists

**Human**

- Observe how they work
- Survey to determine opinions on how things are done

**Software**

- Review your code looking for redundant loops
- Look for alternative packages or libraries which use native code for computation

**Resources**

- Check Task Manager (or similar) to determine CPU utilization
    - Ensure all CPU cores are being utilized
- Using Task Manager, check memory and page file usage
    - Heavy page file usage is a sign of memory exhaustion

## What can be done about them?

**Human**

- Improve training or education
- Hire more people
- Find a faster person

**Software**

- Improve usability (macros, physical interface, etc)
- Select a different tool
- If using in-house code, review and optimize where possible

**Computing Resources**

- Upgrade CPU (faster clock speed or more cores)
- Increase RAM (or memory availability)
- Faster storage (Solid State Disk)

## Identifying Improvements

- Ask users if usability has improved
- Track time to completion
    - Overall
    - Each stage or process
- Monitor resource utilization
    - CPU, Memory, and Storage
