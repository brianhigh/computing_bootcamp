## Defining Aspects

- Velocity
    - New data coming in at a high rate
- Volume
    - 100s to 1000s of gigabytes

## Requirements

- More computing resources
    - Storage
    - CPU
    - Memory (RAM)
- New tools and techniques to manage or process data
    - Distributed databases
    - Parallelization of processes (a single CPU is likely to be a bottleneck)
- New challenges with existing tools
    - Loading entire dataset into memory no longer possible
    
## Example Tools

**Distributed Databases**

- Apache Cassandra
- MongoDB

**Job Control**

- GNU Parallel
