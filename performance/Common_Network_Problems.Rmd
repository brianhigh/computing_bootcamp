## Tools to Help You

**General Connectivity**

- ping 
    - If a response is received, the server is "alive". No response could indicate outage or a firewall blocking ping.
- Network Control Panel
    - Shows current IP information, network profile, etc

**Websites**

- Multiple Browsers
- Sites like, isup.me, which test uptime for a site

## Potential Solutions

**Websites**

- Try waiting 10 - 15 minutes. 
    - The site could be having a problem, or performing maintenance.

**General**

- Often times rebooting will clear up odd issues
- Replace your network cable
    - Intermittent network issues can be caused by a defective network cable
- If you're at home, you can try rebooting your router or modem
    - A router is basically a tiny computer, and it too sometimes needs a reboot
