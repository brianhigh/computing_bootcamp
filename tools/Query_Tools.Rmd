## How do I choose one?

- What are others in your group using?
    - Everyone can follow the same process or procedure
    - Support for the same import and export formats
- Do you need to export information in a particular format?
    - Not all tools support the same export formats
- Will you be performing any analysis or other processing of the query results?
    - It may be best to query from within your analysis software (if possible)
