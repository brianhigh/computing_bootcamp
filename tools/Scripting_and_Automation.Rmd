# Scripting

## Benefits

- <font color=darkblue>Change tracking</font> (you can store your scripts in a version control system)
- <font color=darkblue>Less prone to errors</font> (every time you run it, it'll be the same)
- <font color=darkblue>Easy to Share</font> (just hand over your code and they can run the same operation)
- <font color=darkblue>You can walk away</font> (you don't have to sit and wait for each step to finish)
- <font color=darkblue>Reference material</font> (well written scripts serve as documentation)

## Languages

**Builtin Options:**

- Bash (or any other shell)
- Batch File
- Powershell

**Other Options:**

- R
- Python
- Perl
