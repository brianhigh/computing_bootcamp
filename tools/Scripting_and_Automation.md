# Scripting

## Benefits

- <font color=darkblue>Change tracking</font> (you can store your scripts in a version control system)
- <font color=darkblue>Less prone to errors</font> (every time you run it, it'll be the same)
- <font color=darkblue>Easy to Share</font> (just hand over your code and they can run the same operation)
- <font color=darkblue>You can walk away</font> (you don't have to sit and wait for each step to finish)
- <font color=darkblue>Reference material</font> (well written scripts serve as documentation)

## Languages

**Builtin Options:**

- Bash (or any other shell on Linux or OS X)
- Batch File (Windows)
- Powershell (Windows)

**Other Options:**

- R
- Python
- Perl

## Tips

- Use an editor that offers syntax high-lighting
- Use soft tabs instead of hard tabs
    - Most editors have an option to set TAB to be 4 spaces
    - Code will appear consistent between editors and operating systems
- Logically name variables and functions
    - Names like "DATA_IN" and "DATA_OUT" instead of "FILE1", "FILE2", etc
- Be consistent in your naming convention
- Put comments in your scripts
    - Explain why you are doing something isn't obvious
    - Explain how something works if the code isn't clear

# Automation

## Requirements

- Depends on scripting
- Consistent environment (software and data format)

## Examples

- Fetching and importing data files from an FTP server into a database
- Generating updated charts and graphs from changing data files
- Backing up the contents of a directory
